# Experiment 0 — Digital Output and Display Interfacing

## 1. LED Blink

### Objective

To interface an LED with an Arduino board and program it to blink at specific time intervals using digital output pins and delay functions. The experiment demonstrates the basic operation of GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output), use of `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, and timing control using `delay()` in Arduino programming.

---

### Understanding

In this program, the LED connected to digital pin 13 of the Arduino is controlled using software instructions. Inside the `setup()` function, pin 13 is configured as an output pin using `pinMode(13, OUTPUT)`.

The `loop()` function runs continuously. The instruction `digitalWrite(13, HIGH)` turns the LED ON by supplying voltage to the pin, and `delay(1200)` keeps it ON for 1200 milliseconds (1.2 seconds). Then `digitalWrite(13, LOW)` turns the LED OFF, and `delay(1400)` keeps it OFF for 1400 milliseconds (1.4 seconds).

Thus, the LED repeatedly blinks with different ON and OFF durations, demonstrating basic Arduino programming and timing control.

---

### Code

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1200);

  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1400);
}
```

---

### Screenshot

---

### Conclusion

The LED blinking program was successfully implemented using the Arduino board. The experiment demonstrated how to configure a digital pin as an output and control the ON/OFF state of an LED using `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` functions.

The LED blinked continuously with specified timing intervals, verifying the correct operation of the program and providing a basic understanding of Arduino GPIO control and embedded programming concepts.

---

## 2. 7-Segment Display

### Objective

To interface a 7-segment display with an Arduino board and display numerical digits from 0 to 9 using digital output pins. The experiment demonstrates the working principle of seven-segment displays, array-based programming, and digital output control in embedded systems.

---

### Theory

A 7-segment display consists of seven LEDs labeled as `a` to `g`. Different combinations of these segments are turned ON or OFF to display numerical digits.

In this program, the segment pins are stored in the array `segPins[7]`, where each element corresponds to one segment of the display. Another two-dimensional array `digits[10][7]` stores the segment patterns required to display digits from `0` to `9`.

The function `displayDigit(int num)` takes a digit as input and activates the corresponding segments by sending HIGH or LOW signals to the display pins using `digitalWrite()`.

Inside the `loop()` function, a `for` loop continuously counts from `0` to `9`. Each digit is displayed for 1 second using `delay(1000)`.

This experiment demonstrates display interfacing, array handling, function usage, looping structures, and GPIO programming using Arduino.

---

### Code

```cpp
int segPins[7] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8};

byte digits[10][7] = {
  {1,1,1,1,1,1,0}, //0
  {0,1,1,0,0,0,0}, //1
  {1,1,0,1,1,0,1}, //2
  {1,1,1,1,0,0,1}, //3
  {0,1,1,0,0,1,1}, //4
  {1,0,1,1,0,1,1}, //5
  {1,0,1,1,1,1,1}, //6
  {1,1,1,0,0,0,0}, //7
  {1,1,1,1,1,1,1}, //8
  {1,1,1,1,0,1,1}  //9
};

void displayDigit(int num)
{
  for(int i=0; i<7; i++)
  {
    digitalWrite(segPins[i], digits[num][i]);
  }
}

void setup()
{
  for(int i=0; i<7; i++)
  {
    pinMode(segPins[i], OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop()
{
  for(int count=0; count<=9; count++)
  {
    displayDigit(count);
    delay(1000);
  }
}
```

---

### Conclusion

The 7-segment display was successfully interfaced with the Arduino board to display digits from 0 to 9 sequentially. The experiment demonstrated how multiple digital output pins can be controlled using arrays and functions to generate different display patterns.

The program verified the proper operation of GPIO control, looping structures, and display interfacing techniques in embedded systems using Arduino programming.

---

## 3. LED Matrix Display

### Objective

To interface an 8×8 LED matrix display with an Arduino board and display the character `T` using row-column scanning techniques. The experiment demonstrates multiplexing, GPIO control, binary pattern representation, and matrix display interfacing in embedded systems.

---

### theory

An 8×8 LED matrix consists of 64 LEDs arranged in rows and columns. Each LED is controlled by activating a specific row and column simultaneously.

In this program, the row pins are stored in the array `rowPins[8]` and the column pins are stored in `colPins[8]`. The binary pattern representing the letter `T` is stored in the array `T[8]`.

Each binary value corresponds to one row of the matrix:
- `1` represents an LED that should glow.
- `0` represents an LED that should remain OFF.

Inside the `loop()` function, the program scans each row one at a time. First, all rows are turned OFF. Then the required column pattern is applied using `digitalWrite()` and `bitRead()` functions. Finally, the selected row is activated for a very short duration using `delay(2)`.

This rapid scanning process occurs continuously, creating the illusion of a stable character display due to persistence of vision.

The experiment demonstrates matrix multiplexing, binary data representation, row-column addressing, and display interfacing using Arduino.

---

### Code

```cpp
int rowPins[8] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
int colPins[8] = {10,11,12,13,A3,A2,A1,A0};

// Letter T
byte T[8] = {
  B11111111,
  B00011000,
  B00011000,
  B00011000,
  B00011000,
  B00011000,
  B00011000,
  B00011000
};

void setup()
{
  for(int i=0; i<8; i++)
  {
    pinMode(rowPins[i], OUTPUT);
    pinMode(colPins[i], OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop()
{
  for(int row=0; row<8; row++)
  {
    for(int i=0; i<8; i++)
    {
      digitalWrite(rowPins[i], LOW);
    }

    for(int col=0; col<8; col++)
    {
      if(bitRead(T[row], 7-col))
      {
        digitalWrite(colPins[col], LOW);
      }
      else
      {
        digitalWrite(colPins[col], HIGH);
      }
    }

    digitalWrite(rowPins[row], HIGH);

    delay(2);
  }
}
```

## **Working Principle**

The calculator accepts expressions in infix form such as:

```text
86*55-(9/4)
```

The processing flow is:

```text
INFIX
   ↓
INFIX TO PREFIX
   ↓
PREFIX EVALUATION
   ↓
RESULT DISPLAY
```

The expression is first converted into prefix notation and then evaluated using stack-based processing.

---

### **Why Prefix Conversion Was Used**

The prefix conversion mechanism was implemented to demonstrate compiler-design concepts and stack-based expression evaluation.

Advantages:

- Better understanding of operator precedence
- Structured parsing method
- Simplified evaluation logic
- Educational demonstration of expression conversion

Example:

### **Infix Expression**

```text
7+8*2
```

### **Prefix Expression**

```text
+7*82
```

The calculator internally evaluates the converted prefix expression.

---

### **Prefix Evaluation Method**

The prefix expression is evaluated from:

```text
Right → Left
```

Algorithm:

1. Read symbol
2. If operand:
    - push to stack
3. If operator:
    - pop two operands
    - apply operation
    - push result back

Looking at your screenshots — sine and triangle look great, PWM just needs fixing. Here's the Exp 3 section to add directly to your report:

# Experiment 3 — Multi-Waveform Generator

## 1.Waveform Generator

### Objective

To design and implement a multi-waveform generator using Arduino Uno, an 8-bit R-2R DAC, a Nokia PCD8544 LCD display, push buttons, and a potentiometer. The system generates sine, triangle, and PWM waveforms selectable via dedicated push buttons, with frequency controlled by a potentiometer.

### Working Principle

The waveform generator operates three independent wave logics unified under a single non-blocking loop. The triangle wave logic increments and decrements an integer `value` by a fixed step of 8 between 0 and 255, writing each step to the 8-bit R-2R DAC on pins D6–D13 using bitwise shifting — this is the exact logic from the standalone triangle sketch. The sine wave logic advances a floating-point `angle` variable by 0.2 radians per step, computes `127 + 127 * sin(angle)`, and writes the result to the same DAC — identical to the standalone sine sketch. The PWM logic toggles pin D5 HIGH and LOW with a fixed 500 µs half-period, matching the original standalone PWM sketch exactly. Since sine and triangle are never active simultaneously — the push buttons ensure only one is selected at a time — both safely share the same DAC pins without conflict. The key integration technique is replacing each sketch's `delayMicroseconds()` with a `micros()`-based non-blocking timer, so the PWM toggle and the DAC output each check elapsed time independently without freezing one another. The potentiometer on A5 maps to the DAC update interval (controlling sine and triangle frequency), while PWM remains fixed at 1 kHz as in the original. The PCD8544 display refreshes every 300 ms showing the active waveform name, step size, amplitude, and output pin.

### Conclusion

The experiment successfully demonstrated a multi-waveform generator using Arduino and an 8-bit R-2R DAC. All three waveforms — sine, triangle, and PWM — operated correctly and were clearly visible on the oscilloscope. The non-blocking `micros()` timing approach preserved the original wave mathematics from each standalone sketch while allowing all three to coexist in a single unified program. The potentiometer provided real-time frequency control for sine and triangle waves, and the Nokia PCD8544 display correctly reported waveform characteristics for each selected mode.

# Experiment 4 — RTC-Based Smart Monitoring and Automation System

## **Objective**

The objective of this experiment was to interface the DS1307 Real Time Clock (RTC) module with Arduino Uno using the I2C communication protocol and display real-time clock data on a 16×2 LCD display. The project was further extended to implement alarm functionality, keypad-based time configuration, automatic motor control, and periodic temperature logging using a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor.  

---

## **Introduction**

Real Time Clock (RTC) modules are widely used in embedded systems where accurate timekeeping is required independently of the main controller operation. The DS1307 RTC module communicates with microcontrollers using the I2C bus and maintains time even during power interruptions through a backup battery.

In this experiment, the RTC module was interfaced with an Arduino Uno to create a fully functional real-time monitoring and automation system. The system was developed progressively in multiple stages:

- basic RTC clock display,
- keypad-based time and alarm setting,
- alarm buzzer system,
- automatic motor switching,
- and periodic temperature recording.

## **Theory**

## **DS1307 RTC Module**

The DS1307 is a low-power Real Time Clock IC that communicates using the I2C protocol. It stores:

- seconds,
- minutes,
- hours,
- day,
- date,
- month,
- and year information.

The RTC maintains accurate time using an external crystal oscillator and battery backup.

The Arduino communicates with the RTC through:

- SDA (Serial Data Line)
- SCL (Serial Clock Line)

using the `Wire.h` library.

---

## **I2C Communication**

I2C is a synchronous serial communication protocol that uses only two wires:

- SDA → data transfer
- SCL → clock signal

The Arduino acts as the master device while the DS1307 acts as the slave device.

Advantages:

- minimal wiring,
- multiple device support,
- synchronized communication,
- reliable data transfer.

---

## **LCD Interfacing**

The 16×2 LCD was interfaced in 4-bit mode using the `LiquidCrystal` library. The LCD continuously displays:

- current time,
- temperature,
- motor state,
- and system modes.

---

## **Keypad Control System**

A 2×2 keypad arrangement was implemented using four push buttons.

### **Functional Buttons**

| **Button** | **Function**           |

## **Temperature Logging**

The DS18B20 digital sensor was used for ambient temperature monitoring.

The sensor communicates using the OneWire protocol and periodically sends temperature values to the Arduino.

Temperature data is:

- displayed on the LCD,
- and logged to the Serial Monitor every 15 minutes.

## **Development and Code Progression**

The project was developed incrementally in three major stages.

---

### **Stage 1 — Basic RTC Clock and Alarm System**

The first implementation focused on RTC interfacing and user-controlled clock management.

## **Features Implemented**

- DS1307 RTC interfacing
- LCD clock display
- keypad scanning
- time configuration
- alarm setting
- buzzer activation

### **Main Functional Blocks**

|**Function**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|`readTime()`|Reads RTC registers|
|`setRTCTime()`|Writes updated time to RTC|
|`scanKeypad()`|Detects keypad inputs|
|`drawAll()`|Updates LCD contents|
|`incrementValue()`|Increases selected parameter|
|`decrementValue()`|Decreases selected parameter|

---

## **System Operation**

The RTC continuously sends current time information to the Arduino. The LCD displays:

```text
HH:MM:SS
```

The user can enter configuration mode using the keypad and modify:

- hour,
- minute,
- second,
- alarm hour,
- alarm minute.

When current time matches alarm time:

- the buzzer activates for 10 seconds.

---

## **Key Learning Outcomes**

This stage established:

- stable I2C communication,
- LCD interfacing,
- keypad matrix scanning,
- and RTC register handling.

### **Stage 2 — Automatic Motor Control System**

The second stage transformed the RTC system into a simple automation controller.

---

## **Objective**

To automatically control a water pump based on water supply availability.

---

## **Functional Enhancements Added**

### **New Variables Introduced**

```cpp
bool motorState;
unsigned long motorStartTime;
unsigned long waterLostTime;
bool waterPreviouslyPresent;
```

### **New Function Added**

```cpp
void handlePumpControl()
```

---

## **Working Logic**

The water supply was simulated using a push-button input connected to pin A1.

### **Operating Conditions**

|**Water Condition**|**Motor Action**|
|---|---|
|Water available|Motor turns ON|
|Water unavailable|OFF timer starts|
|10 minutes elapsed|Motor turns OFF|

---

## **Automation Principle**

When water becomes available:

1. motor starts automatically,
2. runtime timer starts.

The motor turns OFF if:

- water supply disappears,
- or runtime exceeds 10 minutes.

---

## **System Improvements**

The LCD was modified to additionally display motor state:

```text
ON / OFF
```

---

### **Stage 3 — Temperature Logging and Monitoring**

The final stage integrated environmental sensing and serial logging.

---

## **Objective**

To periodically record ambient temperature values for temperature prediction and monitoring purposes.  

---

## **Sensor Used**

Instead of LM35 mentioned in the experiment sheet, a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor was implemented due to:

- digital accuracy,
- easier interfacing,
- and OneWire communication support.

---

## **Additional Libraries Added**

```cpp
#include <OneWire.h>
#include <DallasTemperature.h>
```

---

## **New Functionalities Added**

- DS18B20 interfacing
- LCD temperature display
- serial temperature logging
- periodic sensor polling
- timestamped data recording

---

## **Logging Mechanism**

Temperature values were logged every:

```text
15 minutes
```

using RTC timestamps.

### **Sample Output**

```text
TIME: 00:15:00 TEMP: 23.00 C
```

---

## **Main Function Added**

```cpp
void handleTemperatureLogging()
```

---

## **Working Principle**

The Arduino continuously:

1. reads RTC time,
2. acquires sensor temperature,
3. updates LCD,
4. checks logging interval.

At every 15-minute boundary:

- data is transmitted through the Serial Monitor.

This stage integrated:

- RTC timing,
- sensor interfacing,
- serial communication,
- and periodic event scheduling.

Code progression was implemented incrementally through RTC interfacing, automation control, and temperature logging modules.

---

## **Problems Faced During Implementation**

Several practical issues were encountered during system development.

---

### **1. Internal Input Handling Issues**

### **Problem**

The keypad initially produced:

- unstable inputs,
- repeated key detections,
- accidental mode switching.

This made:

- time setting inconsistent,
- menu handling unreliable.

---

### **Cause**

Mechanical switch bouncing and rapid polling caused multiple detections for a single press.

---

### **Solution**

Software debouncing was implemented using:

```cpp
delay(40);
```

along with key release detection:

```cpp
while(scanKeypad()==k);
```

This stabilized keypad operation significantly.

---

### **2. Mode Switching and Time Setting Errors**

### **Problem**

While changing modes:

- LCD values updated,
- but RTC values sometimes failed to synchronize correctly.

---

### **Cause**

The local variables and RTC registers were not refreshed immediately after writing updated time.

---

### **Solution**

After saving:

1. RTC values were re-read,
2. display variables refreshed,
3. mode reset correctly.

This resolved synchronization inconsistencies.

---

### **3. Motor Turning OFF Too Quickly**

### **Problem**

Initially the motor turned OFF almost immediately after switching ON.

---

### **Cause**

Incorrect timer values were used:

```cpp
10000 ms
```

which corresponds to:

```text
10 seconds
```

instead of the intended longer runtime.

---

### **Solution**

Timer values were modified to:

```cpp
600000 ms
```

which corresponds to:

```text
10 minutes
```

The motor then operated correctly.

---

### **4. Temperature Reading Showing −127°C**

### **Problem**

The DS18B20 sensor initially displayed:

```text
-127°C
```

instead of actual temperature values.

---

### **Cause**

This occurred due to:

- improper wiring,
- missing pull-up resistor,
- unstable data line communication.

---

### **Solution**

A 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor was connected between:

- DATA pin,
- and +5V.

After correction:

- proper temperature readings were obtained.

## **Observations**

|**System Module**|**Observation**|
|---|---|
|RTC Module|Accurate timekeeping achieved|
|LCD Display|Stable real-time updates|
|Keypad System|Proper mode control achieved|
|Alarm System|Successful buzzer activation|
|Motor Automation|Correct timed switching observed|
|Temperature Logging|Stable periodic logging achieved|

---

## **Time Drift**

Time drift refers to the gradual deviation of RTC time from actual real-world time due to oscillator inaccuracies.

In the DS1307 RTC:

- small drift occurs over long durations,
- mainly due to crystal oscillator tolerances,
- temperature variation,
- and power stability.

## Final Remarks

Across these experiments, the focus gradually shifted from simple digital I/O operations to complete embedded systems integrating sensors, displays, communication protocols, automation logic, and real-time data processing. Together, the projects demonstrate practical application of electronics, programming, data structures, and system design concepts using the Arduino ecosystem.

## **Conclusion**

The project progressively evolved from:

- a basic RTC clock,  
    to
- an alarm system,
- motor automation controller,
- and finally a temperature logging platform.

The experiment verified practical implementation of:

- I2C communication,
- RTC interfacing,
- LCD interfacing,
- keypad scanning,
